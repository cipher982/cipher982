I build AI-powered applications and infrastructure. Most of my work involves autonomous agents, LLM tooling, and shipping real products — from computer vision systems to full-stack web apps. The dashboard above tracks my AI pair programming workflow in real time.

## How I Build

The dashboard at the top updates automatically every 6 hours. It tracks my AI-native development workflow — combining traditional git commits with AI pair programming sessions across multiple tools.

- **4 AI coding agents** running in parallel: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini, Cursor
- **Avg {{AVG_TURNS}} turns/session** — deep problem-solving, not quick prompts
- All metrics computed locally and via the [Longhouse](https://longhouse.ai) API
